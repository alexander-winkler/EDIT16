# EDIT16

The [EDIT16](http://edit16.iccu.sbn.it/) is the retrospective national bibliography of books printed in Italy in the 16th century. It is a highly useful resource for anybody dealing with the culture of late Renaissance Italy or book history in general.
The data is published by the [Istituto Centrale per il Catalogo Unico (ICCU)](https://www.iccu.sbn.it/it/) under a CC-BY 3.0 licence. 

The EDIT16 catalogue is searchable via a functional [online form](http://edit16.iccu.sbn.it/web_iccu/imain.htm).
For more advanced queries, however, the online form is not necessarily the best entry point.
As of now, the EDIT16 does not appear to have any API, so I present here a data dump that represents the data in EDIT16 as of 2020-11-14 through 2020-11-15 when the download was done.

# Description of the Data

The folder `EDIT_MARCXML` contains the EDIT16 data that has been converted from UNIMARC to MARCXML.


# Todo

I have done some analyses on the data that I'm currently preparing for publication here in the repo.
